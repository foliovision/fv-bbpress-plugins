How to handle moderation and threads.

Put this at the top of topic.php:

global $topic_id, $bbdb, $bb_current_user;
$topic = $bbdb->get_row( "SELECT post_status, poster_id FROM bb_posts WHERE topic_id = '{$topic_id}' ORDER BY post_time LIMIT 1" );

if( $topic->post_status == -1 && $topic->poster_id != $bb_current_user->ID && !current_user_can('manage_options') ) {
	$user_not_authorized = true;
}

Then you can include the login for like this:

<?php if( $user_not_authorized ) : ?>

	<p>You are not authorized to view this thread, please login below:</p>
	
	<div class="fv-access-denied">
		<?php
		$login_form_show = true;
		include('login-form-html.php'); ?>
	</div>

<?php else : ?>


front-page.php

Put this at the start of the loop:

	global $bbdb, $bb_current_user;
	$topic_private = $bbdb->get_row( "SELECT post_status, poster_id FROM bb_posts WHERE topic_id = '{$topic->topic_id}' ORDER BY post_time LIMIT 1" );

	$private = '';
	if( $topic_private->topic_status == -1 ) {
		if( current_user_can('manage_options') || $bb_current_user->ID == $topic_private->poster_id ) {
			$private = ' <em>(private)</em>';
		} else {
			continue;
		}	
	}

And echo $private behind the title.


forum.php:

Put this before each foreach loop:

<?php if ( $topics ) : foreach ( $topics as $topic ) {
  global $bb_current_user;
	$tmp_topic_ids = array();
	foreach( $topics AS $topic ) {
		$tmp_topic_ids[] = $topic->topic_id;
	}
	$tmp_topic_ids = implode( ',', $tmp_topic_ids );
	$moderated = $bbdb->get_results( "SELECT topic_id, post_id, post_time, post_status, poster_id FROM {$bbdb->prefix}posts WHERE topic_id IN ({$tmp_topic_ids}) GROUP BY topic_id HAVING MIN(post_time)", OBJECT_K );
} endif; ?>


Put this at the start of every loop:

	$private = '';
	if( isset( $moderated[$topic->topic_id] ) && $moderated[$topic->topic_id]->post_status == -1 ) {
		if( current_user_can('manage_options') || $bb_current_user->ID == $moderated[$topic->topic_id]->poster_id ) {
			$private = ' <em>(private)</em>';
		} else {
			continue;
		}
	}
	?>
	
Then after each title:

		echo $private;
